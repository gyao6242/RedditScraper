# RedditScraper
CIS542 Class Project

This project uses the following Python libraries and modules
- PRAW       (https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- pandas     (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html)
- tkinter    (https://tkdocs.com/index.html)
- plyer      (https://plyer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- time       (https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html)
- threading  (https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html

To run this Reddit scraper, you'll need a Reddit account, and an instance of a Reddit API.
The Reddit API can be obtained by going to reddit.com/prefs/apps and creating an application.
- Enter the application's name
- Select 'script'
- Description is optional, however I'd recommend leaving a description.
- Enter the reddit link that is to be scraped in 'about url'\
- 'redirect uri' is not used in script applications, however it is still a manatory field. (http://localhost:8080 can be used here)

After cloning this repository and creating an instance of Reddit's API, launch the .exe found in the /dist/ folder.
